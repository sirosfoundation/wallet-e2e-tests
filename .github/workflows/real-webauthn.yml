# Real WebAuthn E2E Tests
#
# This workflow runs WebAuthn tests in headed mode with Xvfb,
# using Chrome's software authenticator instead of CDP virtual authenticators.
#
# This catches bugs that CDP mocking misses, such as:
# - PRF extension returning empty results
# - User handle extraction issues
# - Discoverable credential flow problems
